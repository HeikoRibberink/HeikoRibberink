Hello, I'm Heiko Ribberink, and am known in some places as blijde_broers.

I like machine learning, game development and computer science, preferably with friends.

I am currently developing a local coop puzzel platforming game in unity, and I am learning win32 with C.

Because of anonymity, I am not currently unreachable.
